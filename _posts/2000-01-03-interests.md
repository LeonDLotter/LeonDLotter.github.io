Early on in my medical studies, I started to focus on child and adolescent psychiatry. In the context of my MD thesis, I then developed a broad interest into neurobiological processes involved in the development of psychiatric traits and disorders. 

Often in clinical research, studies focus on only *a specific aspect* of a psychiatric trait, measured at *a single time point* in a *heterogeneous patient group*. I think that, in order for research in child and adolescent psychiatry to finally transfer into the clinic, we need to recognize that
<ol type="i">
<li>complex atypical behavior arises from interactions between multiple biological systems,</li>  
<li>most psychiatric disorders do not occur suddenly, but may have their first origins in early neurodevelopment, and </li>
<li>atypical neurobiological processes that lead to similar atypical behavior may differ widely between individuals. </li>
</ol>

Integrative data acquisition and analysis approaches that try to incorporate this view might have the potential to move the field significantly forward.  

In my prospective PhD project at the [INM-7 Biomarker Development group](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/inm/inm-7/research-groups/biomarker-development) at JÃ¼lich Research Centre, Germany, I will use "normative modeling" approaches based on large-scale multimodal neuroimaging, genetic, and behavioral data to map atypical neurobiological processes involved in the emergence of neurodevelopmental disorders. The techniques applied will allow us to make predictions about single individuals from unseen cohorts, which we will use to evaluate the potential of our results as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers.
