Early on in my medical studies, I started to focus on child and adolescent psychiatry. In context of my MD thesis, I then developed a broad interest into neurobiological processes involved in the development of psychiatric traits and disorders. 

Often in clinical research, studies focus on one specific aspect at a single time point in a heterogeneous patient group. In order for research in child and adolescent psychiatry to finally transfer into the clinic, we need to recognize (i) that complex atypical behavior arises from interactions between multiple biological systems, (ii) that most psychiatric disorders do not occur suddenly, but may have their first origins in early neurodevelopment, and (iii) that atypical neurobiological processes that lead to similar atypical behavior may differ widely between individuals. I think that integrative data acquisition and analysis approaches that try to incorporate this view have the potential to move my field significantly forward.  

In my prospective PhD project at the [INM-7 Biomarker Development group](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/inm/inm-7/research-groups/biomarker-development) of the JÃ¼lich Research Centre, I will use "normative modeling" approaches based on large-scale multimodal neuroimaging, genetic, and behavioral data to map atypical neurobiological processes involved in the emergence of neurodevelopmental disorders and assess their potential as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers.
