#### A toolbox for flexible assessment of spatial associations between brain images

Spatial (alteration) patterns observed in MRI images may often reflect function and dysfunction of underlying biological systems. This applies alike to function and structure, on the surface or in the volumetric space, to typical activation patterns, or to maps of disordered brain function, for example obtained from patients compared to a reference cohort.  
JuSpyce is a Python toolbox developed to address the question how brain images derived from different modalities covariate with each other. It incorporates methods and ideas from the [JuSpace](https://github.com/juryxy/JuSpace), [BrainSMASH](https://brainsmash.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and [neuromaps](https://netneurolab.github.io/neuromaps/) toolboxes. JuSpyce is especially suited for large-scale analyses trying to reveal how subject-level volumetric or surface neuroimaging data relates spatially to, e.g., nuclear imaging maps of neurotransmitter systems and brain metabolism or atlases of transcriptomic cell type markers. Being based on the the JuSpace toolbox, JuSpyce incorporates diverse univariate and multivariate statistical methods in processing speed-optimized implementations embedded in a user friendly "pipeline-style" workflow. Take a look into the [repository](https://github.com/LeonDLotter/JuSpyce) or get some impression of application scenarios in the [first publication](https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.07.26.501562) using the toolbox!
