## Personal Website

Hi, this repository subserves my personal website at [leondlotter.github.io](https://leondlotter.github.io)

<hr>

The site is build with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) using the [Freelancer](https://github.com/jeromelachaud/freelancer-theme) Jekyll template by [Jerome Lachaud](https://github.com/jeromelachaud).
I made some adaptations, if you'd like to adopt these and create your own site, just fork this repository and change it to your needs. Don't forget to credit the original theme!  
I also got some ideas from Stephan Heunis' [site](https://jsheunis.github.io/).
